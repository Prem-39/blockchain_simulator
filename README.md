# Blockchain Simulator

Blockchain Simulator is a tool used to simulate the behavior of Bitcoin (and other proof-of-work blockchains) from within the browser.

This tool can generate network topologies, mimic the behavior of real nodes, simulate how these layouts affect the distributed consensus of the system as a whole, and measure the outcomes.

Various attacks can be crafted and measured. A few notable ones are as follows:
- 51% attack
- Eclipse attack
- Finney attack
- Partition attack
- Balance attack
- Uncle block attack

Version two was designed specifically with optimization and performance as the top priority, therefore all DOM elements must be refreshed manually, and can be disabled to avoid the extra computational overhead.
